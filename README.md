# SOC-Intrusion Detection Simulation

This project simulates a cyberattack inside a virutal network build using GNS3. The goal is to demonstrate how a SOC analyst detects and responds to threats using open-sourve tools.

## Purpose 
- Practise offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques
- Learn how to configure and use IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)
- Document findings in a professional and structured way

## Tools & Technologiea 
- GNS3
- Kali Linux (attacker)
- VyOS (router)
- Ubuntu Server (target)
- Suricata (IDS)
- Wireshark

## Network Topology (planned)
Kali Linux (attacker) ↔ VyOS Router ↔ Ubuntu Server (Suricata)
